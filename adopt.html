        <h1>Why Adopt</h1>
        <p>At CCCR, we value creating on-going relationships with our adopters. We understand that there are <br>
            challenges in any transition – so we don’t want you to feel like you’re doing this on your own. Our <br>
            community of volunteers, rescue workers, experts and adopters are part of the extended family you <br>
            join when you adopt from us.</p>
        <h1>How to Adopt</h1>
        <p>New dogs arrive on a regular basis. If you are interested in adopting, regularly check our website,<br> 
            Facebook and Instagram pages. Available dogs with their bios will be posted across all three <br>
            platforms. If you are interested in adopting, you will be required to complete an application.</p> <br>

She is a smart <br> cookie though! She has already learned to stay in her crate overnight <br> or when left for a few hours without issue.
