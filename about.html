  <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
 
  <div class="grid">

    <img src="images/dog1.jpg" alt="..." height="auto" width="700" />
    
    <p>We believe there is the right home out there for all the animals in our rescue and pride ourselves <br>
      on matching our pets to people. Our goal is to find the right forever home for each animal in need! We <br>
      focus on helping dogs, farm animals, small domestics and birds. <br>

      Coveted Canines and Creatures is a not-for-profit organization that is wholly run by unpaid <br>
      volunteers. Everyone on our team donates their time and expertise all for the love of animals! We do <br>
      not have a shelter â€“ we place our dogs in loving foster homes where they feel safe to bloom and can <br>
      learn important socialization skills. Our other animals live at our farm sanctuary where they can heal <br>
      and thrive in a safe and comfortable environment while waiting to find their perfect forever home.</p>

    <p> <span id="title">Our Vision</span> <br>
      To eradicate the global issue of animal homelessness, overpopulation and abuse through compassionate action and education.<br>
      
      <span id="title">Our Mission</span><br>
      To collaborate with local and international communities to save vulnerable animals from high-risk <br>
      environments and place them in safe and loving homes that view them as family members.<br>
      
      To educate people on the plight of animals at risk worldwide and inspire them to actively pursue <br>
      solutions to the problem through rescue and responsible pet ownership.</p>

       We work together to create an environment that is respectful, honest and transparent. We act with <br>
       integrity and accountability to demonstrate our commitment to our mission.<br>
      
      <span>2. WELLBEING</span><br>
      We strongly advocate for the health and well-being of the animals in our care by taking a holistic <br>
      approach to their healthcare in close consultation with licensed professionals; our comprehensive <br>
      protocols on quarantine before transport and vetting are paramount to our success.<br>
      
      <span>3. COMPASSION</span><br>
      We provide our animals with patient, positive, and supportive environments to meet their individual <br>
      needs. We recognize that each pet is unique and needs consistent and compassionate care to fully develop. <br>
      
      <span>4. TEAMWORK/COLLABORATION</span><br>
      We collaborate with our wider community to achieve our collective goals. We build strong <br>
      relationships with our community partners and volunteers, and work together to realize our mission. <br>
      We believe that teamwork is the key to our success.<br>
      
      <span>5. EDUCATION</span><br>
      We provide adopters and fosters with the education and resources needed to provide supportive and <br>
      loving homes for vulnerable animals. We educate the community about the plight of animals locally <br>
      and internationally as a means to encourage the public to join us in our mission to eradicate <br>
      homelessness, abuse and overpopulation.<br>
      
      <span>6. RESPECT</span><br>
      We respect the boundaries of our animals, volunteers, fosters and community partners by valuing <br>
      their diverse backgrounds, contributions, and opinions. We interact in a professional and respectful <br>
      manner at all times.<br></p>
